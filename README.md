### Data Sources

Manufacturing_data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Manufacturing.xlsx", containing detailed information about manufacturing data of  the company

### Tools

- Microsoft Excel- Data Cleaning  [Download here](https://microsoft.com)

- Microsoft Power Bi - Data cleaning, Data analysis, Data visualization and reporting

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, the following task was performed:
1. Data Loading  and inspection
2. Handling duplicates and missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

##Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the company's sales data to answer key questions, such as:
- What is our average downtime and top reasons for downtime events
- How well are we meeting quality standards in production 
- How much of energy are we consuming on the average and how we can cut cost and still improve operational efficiency
- How are our suppliers performing and how their performance affects our 
  overall productivity

### Data Analysis

Microsoft powerbi was used to analyze the data and create visuals

### Recommendations

Improve Supplier Coordination: Although lead times are relatively short, further collaboration with suppliers could help reduce variability and ensure a more consistent supply chain, potentially lowering the frequency of material shortages.

Enhance Quality Control: With 117,000 units classified as poor quality, there is a need for stricter quality control measures. Implementing more rigorous inspections and improving employee training could help reduce the production of low-quality goods.

Address Downtime Causes: Since material shortages and human errors are the top reasons for downtime, focus on better inventory management and providing additional training to employees. This could help minimize these disruptions and increase overall productivity.

Optimize Employee Performance: Recognize and reward the top performers while providing additional support and training to the remaining employees to elevate their performance to similar levels.

Energy Efficiency: Given the high average energy consumption, consider exploring energy-efficient technologies or practices that could help reduce energy costs without compromising production output.

Product Focus: Given that industrial mixers and refrigerators are among both the top-produced and top-sold products, consider dedicating more resources to these lines to maximize profitability.
